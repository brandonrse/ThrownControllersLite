      <h1>What is Thrown Controllers?</h1><br>
      <p>Thrown Controllers is a fun video game trivia game show hosted by <a href=https://www.therunawayguys.com target="_blank">The Runaway Guys.</a></p><br>
      <p>The goal is to get 10 questions correct without getting a single one wrong. Do that, and you are the winner.</p><br><br><br>
      
      <h1>Thrown Controllers Lite</h1><br>
      <p>This is an unofficial recreation of the game show. Made to practice some coding. There are differences between this version and Proton Jon's:
      right now, there is only Easy Questions, Tricky Questions, Brutal Questions, Lightning Round, and Multiple Choice implemented. <br><br>
      The questions are also largely Nintendo-oriented questions due to my lack of knowledge on most non-Nintendo games. As a result, feel free to submit questions. If desired, you will be credited.</p><br><br>
      <p>I will say a large reason why I made this, in addition to greatly enjoying watching Thrown Controllers, was because of the fact that Proton Jon will never be able to participate in his own game show.</p>
